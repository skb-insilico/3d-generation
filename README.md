# 3d-generation
Benchmark of 3D conformer generation and molecular property calculation for medium-sized molecules (Tomoki Yonezawa, Tsuyoshi Esaki, Kazuyoshi Ikeda )  

We provide RMSDs between each generated conformer and the PDB structure. The calculation results of 3D descriptors determined using Pipeline Pilot 2018 and Mordred for each conformer with the lowest energy are also presented. Het codes and the SMILES of PDB ligands used in this study were given in csv format.
